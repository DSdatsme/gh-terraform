Demo on how to deploy terraform from GitHub actions on GCP

### Was not feeling lazy so wrote a [Medium story](https://medium.com/@dsdatsme/terraform-gitops-ci-cd-with-approval-notifications-6f0807299fc4) explaining how this repo works. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### This repo was actually created as a demo which was part of my talk at **DevFest Mumbai 2022**. If you are interested in checking out the presentation, here's the [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dABxd4OGN97OPF3ITXKi4Q7QBtHNvbOA).
Later on used the same repo(with some changes) for a 3 hour hands-on workshop at **DevFest Raipur 2022**.
